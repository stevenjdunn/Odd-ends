# Differential Gene Expression Analysis With Kallisto and Degust
# Based on: http://sepsis-omics.github.io/tutorials/modules/kallisto/
# Assumes you have kallisto installed and working, I have it in a conda environment
# Uses denovo annotations from PROKKA in genbank format
# Assumes you have a directory containing all genbank files with appropriate sample name
# Assumes your filenames encode info on condition and replicate number.

### START ###

# Set conda environment
source activate rnaseq


# Move to reference directory
cd ~/Reads/BBSRC/RNA/Parental

# Convert genbank to gene-based fasta and feature table
for f in *.gbk; do echo "python genbank_to_kallisto.py $f ${f/.gbk/.trans} ${f/.gbk/tsv}#

# Pass headers to feature tables:
for f in *.tsv; do sed -i $'1 i\\\nlocustag\tobject\tgene\tec\tfunction' $f; done 

# Index trans file
for f in *.trans do kallisto index -i ${f/.trans/.idx} $f

# Now on a per-sample basis, using sample F047 as an example:
# Set index and feature table variables
i='/home/bioinformatic/Reads/BBSRC/RNA/Parental/F047.idx'
t='/home/bioinformatic/Reads/BBSRC/RNA/Parental/F047.tsv'

# Navigate to sample directory:
cd ~/Reads/BBSRC/RNA/Samples/F047

# Cleanup Liverpool CGR read filenames
for f in *.gz; do mv $f ${f#*-}; done
for f in *.gz; do mv $f ${f/190328_L*_/}; done

# Quantify DGE
for f in *R1.fastq.gz; do kallisto quant -i $i -o ${f/_R1.fastq.gz/} -t 28 $f ${f/R1/R2}; done

# Copy abundances to results folder
for f in */; do cp $f"abundance.tsv" ${f/\//_abundance.tsv}; done

# Extract columns | parallel -j based on number of samples/replicates, with one job per sample
for f in *.tsv; do echo "cut -f4 -d$'\t' ${f} | tail -n +2 > ${f/.tsv/_headless.tsv}"; done > commands.sh
parallel -j 6 < commands.sh

# Remove temp files
rm *abundance.tsv

# Add sample name & condition to header
for f in *.tsv; do echo "echo -e '"${f%_abundance_headless.tsv}"' | cat - $f > ${f/_abundance_headless/}"; done > commands.sh
sed -i "s/'/\\\"/g" commands.sh
parallel -j 6 < commands.sh

# Remove temp files
rm *headless*

# Create final output file
files=*.tsv
paste $files $t > counts.tsv

# Load counts.tsv into Degust with ID set to locustag + gene, and two conditions representing the three biological replicates of PA and CTX
# Sort and save as csv.
