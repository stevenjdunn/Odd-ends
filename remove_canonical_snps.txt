# When mapping to a denovo assembly, you often will identify false positive variants when autologously mapping the original constituitive reads used for the asssembly.
# This can be due to many reasons, for example repetitive regions being collapsed into a single contig, or at the start or end of contigs.
# This affects resequencing of the same strain. As such you will want may want to remove these variants from subsequent sequence data.
# This is based on Snippy's .tab output.

# Step One 
# Collect snps.tab output into a single directory
# Delete the 'Evidence' column from tab files, move output files into new directory
for f in *.tab; do echo "cut -f 6 --complement $f > ${f/.tab/_cut.tab}"; done > commands.sh
bash commands.sh
mkdir Cut
mv *_cut.tab Cut
cd Cut

# Step Two
# Remove the first line from your reference tab file to maintain headers
sed -i '1d' REF_cut.tab

# Step Three
# Using the output from the reference reads mapped against the reference denovo assembly, strip any identical lines.
for f in *.tab; do echo "awk 'NR==FNR{a[$0];next} !($0 in a)' REF_cut.tab $f > ${f/_cut/_trimmed}"; done | sed 's/bash/$0/g' > commands.sh
